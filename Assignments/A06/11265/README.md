## 11265 - The Sultan's Problem
### Instructions
- Find surrounding points
- Find if points are below, above, left or right
- Can find if below, above, or on line by calculating y=mx+b equation for line
- Plug the point in for equation 
- If the y value for point is greater then the point it is above
- If less than, the point is below
- Equal to, the point is on the line
- The line is right/left to the point if it is either a border line or if a nearby line 
is between two lines (lines can be in between when a first point has a greater y then other lines)
