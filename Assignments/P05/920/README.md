## 920 - Sunny Mountains
### Isha Perry
### Description:

The first line of input contains the number of test cases that follows.
Each test case starts with a line containing the number N of coordinate pairs. The remaining N
lines for each test case contain the coordinates defining the landscape. Each of these lines contains two
integers, x and y, separated by a single space. The first integer, x, is the X-coordinate, and the second,
y, is the Y-coordinate of the considered point. The output is formed by a sequence of lines, one for 
each test case. Each line contains a single real number with exactly two decimal digits. This number 
represents the length in meters of the sunny mountain sides for the corresponding test case.
