### Description:

The input file will consist of a series of lines. Each line will contain two integers. 
The first integer, lying within the range [1, 250], will denote the number of disks 
and the second integer, belonging to [0, 2n âˆ’ 1], will be the number of the last move.
The file will end at a line formed by two zeros. The output will consist of a series of lines, 
each denoting the pegs and the disks with each peg.
