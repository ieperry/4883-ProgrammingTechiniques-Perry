### Description:

Input starts with an integer T (T ≤ 100), which indicates the number of test cases. Each of 
the next T line contains three integers L, W and H (1 ≤ L, W, H ≤ 50) denoting the length,
width and height of a rectangular shaped box. For each test case, output a single line. If the 
length, width and height of the box is less than or equal to 20, this line will be ‘Case #: good’, 
otherwise it will be ‘Case #: bad’. The output # will be replaced by the case number.
