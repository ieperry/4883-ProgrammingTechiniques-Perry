### Description:

The first line of input is an integer T (T < 20) that indicates the number of test cases. Each case
consists of a line with 3 distinct positive integers in the range [1000, 10000]. The program will
determine which of the three integers is the number in between the other two (ignores the smallest 
and biggest numbers) then print out that number.
