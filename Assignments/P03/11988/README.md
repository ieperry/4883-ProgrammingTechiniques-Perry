### Isha Perry
### Description:

There are several test cases. Each test case is a single line containing at least one and at most 100,000
letters, underscores and two special characters ‘[’ and ‘]’. ‘[’ means the “Home” key is pressed
internally, and ‘]’ means the “End” key is pressed internally. The input is terminated by end-of-file
(EOF). For each case, print the Beiju text on the screen.
