## 11498 - Division of Nlogonia
### Isha Perry
### Description:

The first line of the input contains one integer K indicating the number of queries that will be made (0 < K ≤ 103). 
The second line of a test case contains two integers N and M (−104 < N, M < 104) representing the coordinates of the 
division point that will create two lines, one line going North-South and the other going East-West, essentially 
creating a 2D graph with four quadrants. Each of the K following lines contains two integers X and Y (−104 ≤ X, Y ≤ 104).
The end of input is indicated by a line containing only the number zero. The program will determine if the coordinates
X and Y lie on one of the two lines (the program will print ‘divisa’), lie in the first quadrant (prints ‘NE’),
lie in the second quadrant (prints ‘NO’), lies in the third quandrant (prints ‘SO’), or the fourth quadrant (prints ‘SE’).
