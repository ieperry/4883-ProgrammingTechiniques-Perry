### Description:

This program calculates donations. The first line of input will contain T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) 
denoting the number of operations. Then there will be T lines each containing the two 
types of operations ‘donate K’ (100 ≤ K ≤ 105) which adds K to the account and the input 
‘report’ that reports all the money currently in the account. Initially the total amount 
of money is 0. For each ‘report’, the program prints the money in the account.
